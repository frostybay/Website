We've just pushed a [repository][repository] to github containing an Express project in a full MVC pattern.

* **Model:** MySQL with simple ORM
* **View:** Handlebars enabled templates
* **Controller:** Execution time loading controllers for easy usage

There are examples of how to use the pattern inside the source code.

Go ahead and fork the repository [here][repository].
